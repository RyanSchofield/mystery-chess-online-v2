Mystery/Discover Chess Variant

playable at: https://discovery-chess-d07e21112259.herokuapp.com/
using the name 'bot tester' (all lowercase) enables the (very WIP) bot

start:
node app.js


how to play: 
choose a name and click a game to join, or click 'create game'.
pieces (except the king) are 'disguised' as another piece until they move for the first time, revealing their true identity.
Other rules, including castling/queening, remain the same except for en passant which is removed for balance.
After you capture a disguised piece, you can view what it is by clicking on the captured pieces, but it remains hidden to the opponent.
